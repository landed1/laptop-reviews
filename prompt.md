I am going to make a fully static website.
For this task you will create just the homepage.

Can you create me a tailwindcss theme using this colour set:
f72585, 7209b7, 3a0ca3 , 4361ee ,4cc9f0

This is for a NEXT.js build and needs to be responsive. I am using lucide-react for icons. So make use of that. 

This will be the home page for a laptop review website for the UK market. So if you add placeholder content may as well use this topic.

NAV
I'd like a nav that when in mobile and desktop has hamburger menu which opens/covers the whole screen and then there is only a menu to pick from.

HERO Section
I am looking for a hero section at the top. This will be 2 blocks the one on the left is text the one on the right is an image. For the text block we have a header and a sub text. Under that a CTA rounded corner button.

Problem Section
I need 4 visual yet text items which highlight a problem that this website will solve. Some kind of list of h3 with an icon check mark. Suggest Save time finding a laptop, Get great value, No technical knowledge needed..

Laptop Inspiration Section
This is a whole width big image.

Solution Section
Now the next section is where I present the solution. This is where you have blocks which link to each category.
Laptops under £300, Laptops under £400, Laptops under £500 ... Laptops from 500 to 700, Laptops from 700 to 1000, Best Mac Laptops under 800, Mac Laptops under 1300, Mac Laptops under 1600.

Our Top Picks
I need a scrollable horizontally section that is just image cards, this is free of text. The user can swipe and the swipe action should have a sticky effect so that there is never an image that is cut off by the viewport. Snap is another way to describe this action.

Archives Section
This will be a place which can hold years and months of old article links. We will have the category pages created each month. So there should be links to a month e.g. /2024/12/best-laptops /2025/1/best-laptops these pages will hold links for each category. But we can build this later. So just create 3 links for now.

FAQ Section
Do a regular accordion component. 3 questions show and the answers get revealed after they click on the item.

Contact Form Section
As this is a static website I will need one block to be a form placeholder that will come from a 3rd party mail list provider such as mailchimp.

Footer Section
